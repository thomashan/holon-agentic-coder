# Executing Unit and Integration Tests

This guide explains how to execute the unit and integration tests, run linting and format checks, and troubleshoot
environment issues in the Holon Agentic Coder repository.

## 1. Running Tests

Testing is managed using `pytest`. The test suite includes both unit tests and docker-based integration tests.

### Running the Entire Test Suite

To run all tests (unit and integration tests), run the following command from the workspace root:

````bash
uv run pytest

> [!NOTE]
> **Why `PYTHONPATH` is not necessary:**
> Because this repository is configured as a `uv` workspace, `uv` automatically resolves local package dependencies.
> Specifically, the root `pyproject.toml` lists `"apps/sandbox-executor"` as a workspace member and sets its source path:
> ```toml
> [workspace]
> members = ["apps/sandbox-executor"]
>
> [tool.uv.sources]
> sandbox-executor = { path = "apps/sandbox-executor" }
> ```
> This configuration allows `uv run` to resolve module imports directly from the active source files (`apps/sandbox-executor/src`) without needing any manual `PYTHONPATH` overrides.



### Running Specific Tests

You can filter tests by their pytest markers (such as `integration_test`) or by target files:

- **Run only integration tests:**
  ```bash
  uv run pytest -m integration_test
````

- **Run only unit tests (excluding integration tests):**
  ```bash
  uv run pytest -m "not integration_test"
  ```
- **Run a specific test file:**
  ```bash
  uv run pytest apps/sandbox-executor/tests/test_planner.py
  ```

## 2. Running Linting and Format Checks

Formatting and code quality are managed using `ruff`.

### Linting Checks

To run the static analysis checks:

```bash
uv run task lint
# Or directly:
uv run ruff check .
```

To automatically fix any autofixable linting issues:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

### Formatting Checks

To check if the files comply with the codebase format guidelines:

```bash
uv run ruff format --check .
```

To automatically reformat the codebase:

```bash
uv run task format
# Or directly:
uv run ruff format .
```

## 3. Managing the Environment & Troubleshooting

### Dealing with Stale Code

If the virtual environment caches a previous build and `pytest` fails to see your local code updates (causing unexpected
`AttributeError` or missing code errors), clean the environment caches:

```bash
uv run task clean
```

_Note: This command clears all python cache directories (`__pycache__`), test caches (`.pytest_cache`), and removes the
root `.venv`. You should run `uv sync` afterwards to re-initialize a clean environment._

### Re-syncing Workspace Dependencies

To recreate and align your local virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

> [!IMPORTANT] **Single Virtual Environment Rule:** Always use the `.venv` located at the root of the workspace. Do NOT
> run commands that initialize a separate virtual environment inside subdirectories (e.g.,
> `apps/sandbox-executor/.venv`), as this will cause package resolution mismatches.
