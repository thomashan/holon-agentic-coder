# Sandbox Planning Architecture Specification

This document defines the extended **Sandbox Planning** architecture for the Holon Agentic Coder, as aligned during
design reviews.

---

## 1. Security & Sandbox Escape Auditing

To prevent execution-time sandbox violations or malicious shell commands, the planning phase includes a pre-execution
audit gate:

- **The Security Auditor Agent:** Once a plan variant is proposed, a specialized Security Auditor Agent runs inside the
  sandbox environment.
- **Audit Scope:** The agent parses all proposed steps, dependencies, and shell commands, comparing them against the
  rules defined in `holon-config/rules/sandbox_policy.json` and the safety guidelines in `docs/safety.md`.
- **Action:** Plans with security policy violations are rejected immediately, and the planner must regenerate the
  variant.

---

## 2. Clean Architecture & Design Conventions

To ensure all proposed code changes conform to the project’s structure and boundaries:

- **Contextual Blueprints:** The system parses architectural boundaries and dependency constraints from
  `holon-config/world/ruleset.md` and active folder hierarchies.
- **Prompt Injection:** These boundaries are injected directly into the planner's prompt template so that the agent has
  explicit, real-time visibility into the code structure rules before writing the plan steps.

---

## 3. Dependency & Bottleneck Risk Mitigation

Bottleneck steps (e.g., database schema changes, core module refactoring) carry high risk:

- **Decomposition Trigger:** If a step is marked as a critical bottleneck (`Is Bottleneck: YES`) and its predicted
  success probability is low (`P(success) < 0.7`), the engine blocks parent execution.
- **Automated Decomposition:** The system automatically decomposes this step into a child **Sub-Intent** with its own
  dedicated git branch, isolated sandbox, and test suites. The step is resolved independently before parent plan
  execution can continue.

---

## 4. Entropy Budgeting & Compliance

Entropy represents the disorder and complexity introduced by plans:

- **Step-Level Partitioning:** The planner distributes the overall intent's entropy budget across individual steps.
- **Hard Compliance Gate:** If the cumulative predicted step entropy exceeds the intent's allocated budget, the plan
  variant is flagged as non-compliant. The planner is forced to either reframe the strategy or decompose the intent
  further.

---

## 5. Peer Review & Plan Selection

Once the competitive planner generates candidate variants:

- **Convergence Phase:** The orchestrator applies a mathematical convergence policy based on Expected Value (EV)
  improvement rates and variant limits.
- **The Evaluator Agent:** Once converged, a separate **Evaluator Agent** reviews the top candidate plan files. The
  Evaluator performs a final review of architectural alignment, security profiles, and cost metrics before selecting and
  locking in the winning plan.

---

## 6. Knowledge & Ruleset Consultation Gate

To avoid repeating past failures and ensure strict compliance with project governance:

- **Ledger Verification:** Before planning, the planner queries the Ledger for similar intents that failed. It
  identifies their failure modes to avoid repeating identical implementation mistakes.
- **KB & WB Retrieval:** The planner retrieves proven patterns and tactics from the Knowledge Base (KB) and universal
  reasoning invariants from the Wisdom Base (WB) to bootstrap the plan structure.
- **World Ruleset Compliance:** The planner must explicitly match the proposed steps against rules in
  `holon-config/world/ruleset.md` and `holon-config/world/constraints.md` to ensure language versions, dependency rules,
  and git flow restrictions are strictly obeyed.

---

## 7. Conditional Spike & Hypothesis Execution

For steps characterized by high uncertainty but high potential epistemic gain:

- **Spike Selection:** If a plan step has a low success probability ($P(success) < 0.6$) but high learning value
  ($LearningValue > 7.0$), the orchestrator conditionally spins up a **Spike / Hypothesis Test**.
- **Sandbox VM Isolation:** The spike runs in a highly isolated, ephemeral container/VM sandbox with zero network or
  host access, dedicated solely to testing the hypothesis (e.g., calling a mock API or running a prototype script).
- **Feedback Loop:** The results of the spike test are written to the ledger, and the main planner uses this new
  diagnostic data to refine the metrics and steps of the final plan before selection.

---

## 8. Continuous Calibration & Estimator Tuning

To ensure that predicted metrics ($P(success)$, $\Delta S$, $Cost$, $LearningValue$) remain calibrated:

- **Tuning Agent Execution:** A background **Calibration & Estimator Tuning Agent** regularly analyzes forensic records
  in the Ledger.
- **Error Minimization:** It compares predicted values to actual measured metrics post-execution and calculates
  calibration errors.
- **Weight Proposals:** If systematic bias is detected, the agent adaptively calculates optimal formula weights and
  proposes estimator revisions to `holon-config/metrics/` (subject to human approval), ensuring the decision engine
  remains calibrated over time.

## 9. Planning Agent Directory: Crucial vs. Optional Tiers

This section outlines the role and operational requirement tier for each specialized agent in the planning lifecycle.

### A. Crucial Agents (Mandatory Core Execution)

These agents must execute for every intent-planning lifecycle to enforce baseline safety, design, and mathematical
correctness:

1. **Planner Agent:**
   - **Role:** Generates candidate plan graphs with step-by-step metrics predictions.
   - **Status:** **CRUCIAL**.
2. **Evaluator Agent:**
   - **Role:** Applies the EV convergence policy, peer-reviews top plan files, and locks the winning plan branch.
   - **Status:** **CRUCIAL**.
3. **Security Auditor Agent:**
   - **Role:** Performs sandbox static audits and command verification against sandbox policies prior to execution.
   - **Status:** **CRUCIAL**.
4. **Calibration & Estimator Tuning Agent:**
   - **Role:** Analyzes ledger errors post-execution and proposes calibrated formula weights to keep EV calculations
     accurate.
   - **Status:** **CRUCIAL**.

### B. Optional Agents (Pluggable / Context-Specific)

These agents are invoked dynamically depending on the task's complexity, cost, uncertainty, or concurrency level:

1. **Conflict Predictor Agent:**
   - **Role:** Analyzes parallel git branch structures and file edit history to estimate conflict likelihood (CL) and
     sequence sibling tasks.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered during concurrent multi-agent executions).
2. **KB Integration & Template Seeding Agent:**
   - **Role:** Queries the Knowledge Base for similar past plans and inserts templates/failure mitigations into the
     prompt.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered if the intent matches active tags in the KB index).
3. **Spike / Hypothesis Tester Agent:**
   - **Role:** Executes rapid, isolated VM tests for uncertain but high-value steps to verify implementation
     feasibility.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered conditionally if step success rate is low and learning value is high).
4. **Complexity Routing Agent:**
   - **Role:** Pre-evaluates the intent text and workspace context to select the appropriate reasoning models (
     Flash/Medium/Deep).
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Invoked at the beginning of the planning lifecycle to optimize model costs).
5. **Resource & Cost Optimization Agent (Budget Agent):**
   - **Role:** Forecasts API token cost and sandbox VM computation times to ensure plan complies with the project's
     financial budget.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered for high-complexity/deep-model routing plans).
6. **Rollback & Resilience Agent (Disaster Planner):**
   - **Role:** Mandates and verifies the insertion of rollback/cleanup steps for any plan steps that alter schema or
     write to database state.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered for plans that involve stateful modifications).
7. **Context Window Optimizer Agent (Attention Agent):**
   - **Role:** Prunes irrelevant codebase source files and documentation from the prompt context.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered for larger codebase scopes to control prompt sizes).
8. **Dependency & License Auditor Agent (Compliance Officer):**
   - **Role:** Audits proposed third-party packages for copyleft conflicts (e.g. GPL compatibility) and CVE safety.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered when the plan modifies `pyproject.toml` or environment lockfiles).
9. **Test Specification Generator Agent (QA Architect):**
   - **Role:** Independently outlines edge cases, test structures, and validation scripts for the plan.
   - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered for high-novelty tasks or where test coverage is a critical metric).
10. **Documentation & Impact Alignment Agent (PR Writer):**
    - **Role:** Drafts pull request descriptions, release notes, and documentation updates mapping the plan's outcome to
      business metrics.
    - **Status:** **OPTIONAL** (Triggered for root intents merging into the canonical base branch).
