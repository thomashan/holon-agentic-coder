Go through all the *.md documentation.
We are going to make the first MVP implementation. The first step is to make an implementation plan.
The root intent is "bootstrap MVP with minimal functionality".
The intent of this session is to build a "detailed plan to bootstrap MVP with minial functionality".
Put the plan in `prompts/bootstrap_{coding_agent}_plan.md` where coding agent is your name (e.g. if you're opencode then `prompts/bootstrap_{coding_agent}_plan.md`)
